# Unknown Lyrics

Melody whispers,  
Unknown lyrics dance in airâ€”  
Mystery unfolds.  

***

There once was a song in the air,  
With lyrics that vanished somewhere.  
Though notes soared and swayed,  
Its meaning delayed,  
Leaving listeners lost in despair.  

***

A song with hidden words can still ignite,  
For in the silence, dreams take flight.
